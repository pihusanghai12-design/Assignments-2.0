    <h1>Box Model</h1>
    <p>The CSS Box Model explains how every element on a web page is like a box. 
        Each box has four parts: content, padding, border, and margin. The content is where text or images appear. 
        The padding is the space between the content and the border. The border goes around the padding and content, and the margin is the empty space outside the border that separates one element from another.
         By adjusting these, we can control the size, spacing, and layout of elements on a webpage.</p>
    <h2>Margin, Border and Padding</h2>   
    <p>In the CSS box model, margin, border, and padding are used to control spacing. 
        Margin is the empty space outside the elementâ€™s border that separates it from other elements. Border is the line that surrounds the content and padding, giving shape to the element.
         Padding is the space between the content and the border, which makes the content look less crowded.</p>
